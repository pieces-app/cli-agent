## Security Measures

### Installation Security

We provide multiple secure installation methods to protect against supply chain attacks:

#### 1. Package Managers (Most Secure)

Package managers provide built-in verification:

```bash
# Homebrew (macOS/Linux) - GPG signed
brew install pieces-cli

# Chocolatey (Windows) - Package verification
choco install pieces-cli

# pip with hash verification
pip install --require-hashes -r https://github.com/pieces-app/cli-agent/releases/latest/download/requirements-hashes.txt
```

#### 2. Verified Script Installation (Recommended)

Download and verify checksums before execution:

```bash
# Download secure installer
curl -LO https://github.com/pieces-app/cli-agent/releases/latest/download/secure-install.sh
curl -LO https://github.com/pieces-app/cli-agent/releases/latest/download/secure-install.sh.sha256

# Verify checksum
sha256sum -c secure-install.sh.sha256

# Run installer
sh secure-install.sh
```

#### 3. Manual Verification

For the standard installation scripts:

```bash
# Download files
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pieces-app/cli-agent/main/install_pieces_cli.sh
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pieces-app/cli-agent/main/install_pieces_cli.sh.sha256

# Verify checksum
sha256sum -c install_pieces_cli.sh.sha256

# Review script (recommended)
less install_pieces_cli.sh

# Execute
sh install_pieces_cli.sh
```

### Signature Verification (Advanced)

We sign our releases using Sigstore/Cosign for additional security:

```bash
# Install Cosign
brew install cosign

# Verify script signature
cosign verify-blob \
  --certificate install_pieces_cli.sh.crt \
  --signature install_pieces_cli.sh.sig \
  --certificate-identity-regexp "https://github.com/pieces-app/*" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  install_pieces_cli.sh
```

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Always verify checksums** before running installation scripts
2. **Use official sources** - only download from github.com/pieces-app
3. **Keep CLI updated** - security patches are released regularly
4. **Enable 2FA** on your GitHub and PyPI accounts
5. **Review scripts** before execution when possible

### For Contributors

1. **Never commit secrets** - use environment variables
2. **Dependencies** - pin versions and use lock files
3. **Code review** - all PRs require security review
4. **Testing** - include security tests for new features
