# Documentation Overview of Python Scripts

## Introduction

This documentation provides an overview of five key Python scripts (`app.py`, `commands.py`, `api.py`, `gui.py`, and `store.py`) that form the backbone of the 'Pieces CLI Tool'. This tool is designed to offer a comprehensive command-line interface for asset and model management.

### `app.py` - The Command Line Interface Core
**Purpose:** Serves as the entry point for the CLI, handling user inputs and command execution.

**Main Features:**
- **Command Parsing:** Utilizes argparse to define and parse a range of commands.
- **Subcommand Management:** Each CLI command (like list, open, delete) is managed through subparsers, linked to specific functionalities.
- **Dynamic Response:** Adjusts its behavior based on the server's status, which it checks using `check_api`.
- **User Interaction:** Provides feedback and guidance to the user based on the input commands and server responses.

### `commands.py` - The Functional Hub
**Purpose:** Acts as a repository of functions that `app.py` calls in response to various commands.

**Key Aspects:**
- **Diverse Command Functions:** Hosts a suite of functions like `ask`, `search`, and `edit_asset`, each aligning with a CLI command.
- **WebSocket Management:** Manages real-time interactions and data flow through WebSocket connections for local and online apis.
- **Asset and Model Operations:** Facilitates operations like listing, editing, and deleting assets and models.
- **Interactive CLI Loop:** Maintains an interactive command loop, enhancing the user experience.

### `api.py` - The API Interaction Layer
**Purpose:** Manages all interactions with the external API, serving as the communication layer between the CLI tool and server.

**Core Functions:**
- **API Client Configuration:** Sets up and configures the `openapi_client` for API interactions.
- **WebSocket Operations:** Through `WebSocketManager`, it handles WebSocket connections for dynamic data exchange.
- **Model and Asset API Calls:** Includes a variety of functions to perform API actions related to models and assets.
- **Platform and API Health Checks:** Determines the operating system category and checks the health and version of the API to make sure the server is running.

### `gui.py` - The User Interface Module
**Purpose:** Provides user interface functionalities for the CLI tool, handling all the print statements and user interaction interfaces.

**Main Features:**
- **User Feedback:** Functions like `welcome`, `line`, `double_line`, `double_space`, and `space_below` for displaying formatted text and separators to enhance user readability.
- **Dynamic Messages:** `print_response` and `print_asset_details` allow for dynamic output based on user actions and search results.
- **User Guidance:** Includes `print_instructions` and `print_help` to guide users through the command usage and options available.
- **Specialized Displays:** Functions like `print_model_details`, `delete_most_recent`, and `no_assets_in_memory` provide context-specific outputs for certain operations.

### `store.py` - The Data Persistence Layer
**Purpose:** Manages the storage and retrieval of application data using SQLite database as a caching strategy.

**Database Interaction:**
- **Connection Management:** `create_connection` establishes a connection to the SQLite database.
- **Table Management:** `create_table` ensures the necessary table structure is in place for storing application data.
- **Data Insertion and Retrieval:** Functions `insert_application` and `get_application` handle the insertion and querying of application data, respectively.

## Conclusion
Each script plays a crucial role in the functionality of the 'Pieces CLI Tool'. `app.py
